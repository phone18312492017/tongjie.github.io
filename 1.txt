Please help me review my account status(flagged due to some mistake)


How can we help?
Dear sir or madam:
I am writing to seek your help. My GitHub account has been flagged and my profile is hidden from public. It brings me a whole lot of trouble because my friends on GitHub cannot see my open source project in my GitHub warehouse. I doubt whether this problem has something to do with my recent network fluctuation. I would appreciate your help if you unlock the hidden profile as soon as possible. Thank you so much!
